#Raspberry Pi scripts


Some scripts that were created during the ghoust development.

These files are NOT the game itself but things like:
- startupscripts
- self-updatescripts
- readonly-mounting


Full documentation on how to setup a Raspebrry Pi from scratch will be available in the (wiki)[https://github.com/Ghoust-game/raspberry/wiki] soon.
